Hallelu-\nWonders bright, and rivers, lake. Hallelu-\nTrail of Tears and Horseshoe Lake. Hallelu-\ntrusting things beyond mistake. Hallelu-\n\nWe were in love. We were in love.\nPalisades! Palisades! Palisades\nI can wait. I can wait.\n\nLamb of God, we sound the horn.\nHallelujah!\nTo us your ghost is born.\nHallelu-\n\nI can't explain the state that I'm in\nThe state of my heart, he was my best friend\nInto the car, from the back seat\nOh admiration in falling asleep\nAll of my powers, day after day\nI can tell you, we swaggered and swayed\nDeep in the tower, the prairies below\nI can tell you, the telling gets old\nTerrible sting and terrible storm\nI can tell you the day we were born\nMy friend is gone, he ran away\nI can tell you, I love him each day\nThough we have sparred, wrestled and raged\nI can tell you I love him each day\nTerrible sting, terrible storm\nI can tell you...",

It was before\nThe origin of lovex4\nThe origin of love\n\nAnd there were three sexes then, one that looked\nlike two men glued up back to back,\nCalled the children of the sun.\nAnd similar in shape and girth were the \nchildren of the earth. They looked like\nTwo girls rolled up in one.\nAnd the children of the moon were like a fork shoved on a spoon.\nThey were part sun, part earth, part daughter, part son.\nOooh, The origin of love\n\nNow the gods grew quite scared, Of our\n strength and defiance And Thor said,\n\"I'm gonna kill them all With my hammer,\nLike I killed the giants.\"\nAnd Zeus said, \"No,\nYou better let me\nUse my lightening, like scissors,\nLike I cut the legs off the whales\nAnd dinosaurs into lizards.\"\nThen he grabbed up some bolts\nAnd he let out a laugh,\nSaid, \"I'll split them right down the middle.\nGonna cut them right up in half.\"\nAnd then storm clouds --gathered above\nInto great balls of fire\n\nAnd then fire shot down\nFrom the sky in bolts\nLike shining blades Of a knife.\nAnd it ripped\nRight through the flesh\nOf the children of the sun\nAnd the moon\nAnd the earth.\nAnd some Indian god\nSewed the wound into a hole,\nPulled it round to our belly\nTo remind us --the price we pay.\nAnd Osiris and the gods of the Nile\nGathered up a big storm\nTo blow a hurricane,\nTo scatter us away,\nIn a flood of wind and rain,\nAnd a sea of tidal waves,\nTo wash us all away,\nAnd if we don't behave\nThey'll cut us down again\nAnd we'll be hopping round on one foot\nAnd looking through one eye.\n\nLast time I saw you\nWe had just split in two.\nYou were looking at me.\nI was looking at you.\nYou had a way so familiar,\nBut I could not recognize,\nCause you had blood on your face;\nI had --blood in my eyes.\nBut I could swear by your expression\nThat the pain down in your soul\nWas the same as the one down in mine. \nThat's the pain,\nThat Cuts a straight line\nDown through the heart;\nWe called it love.\nSo we wrapped our arms around each other,\nTrying to shove ourselves back together.\nWe were making love,\nMaking love.\nIt was a cold dark evening,\nSuch a long time ago,\nWhen by the mighty hand of Jove,\nIt was the sad story\nHow we became\nLonely two-legged creatures,\nIt's the story of\nThe origin of love.\nThat's the origin of love.",
